            <h2>MARINE EXPOSURE</h2>
            <p>This project involved developing a 2D game using Scratch, a visual
              programming language. The game features a crab character navigating a marine environment, avoiding
              obstacles, and searching for its home. The gameplay focuses on spatial reasoning and problem-solving, as
              the player controls the crab's movements to successfully reach its destination. This project demonstrates
              basic game development skills, including character control, collision detection, and level design within
              the Scratch environment.</p>

            <h2>Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>This project focused on creating a dynamic personal portfolio website. A key
              feature is a form that users can fill out to generate their own personalized portfolio. This involves
              front-end development (HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript) to create the form interface and dynamically
              populate the portfolio content based on the user's input. This project demonstrates skills in web
              development, data handling, and potentially server-side scripting if the portfolio data is stored and
              retrieved from a database.</p>

            <p>This project involved building a website dedicated to food blogging, specifically
              focusing on Pakistani cuisine. The website allows users to create and publish blog posts about food,
              recipes, and culinary experiences related to Pakistan. This project likely involved both front-end
              development for the user interface and content display, as well as back-end development (potentially using
              a CMS like WordPress or a custom solution) to manage user accounts, blog posts, and other website data.

            <p>This project centered on designing the user interface and user experience
              for a website using Figma, a design tool. The project likely involved creating wireframes, mockups, and
              prototypes to visualize the website's layout, functionality, and user flow. This demonstrates skills in
              UI/UX design principles, information architecture, visual design, and interaction design within the Figma
              environment. The designs created in Figma can then be used by developers to build the actual website.</p>

        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate and versatile developer with a diverse skill set spanning game development, web design, and software engineering. I thrive on bringing creative ideas to life, whether it's through interactive games, dynamic websites, or robust applications.

          My journey began with game development, where I honed my skills in creating engaging 2D games using platforms like Scratch. "Crab's Journey" is a testament to my ability to craft fun and challenging gameplay experiences.
          
          Driven by a passion for web technologies, I ventured into web development, building dynamic and personalized websites. I've developed portfolio websites with form-driven content generation, empowering users to showcase their work effortlessly. My experience also extends to creating content-rich platforms like food blogs, demonstrating my ability to build user-friendly and feature-rich web applications.
          
          My commitment to user-centric design led me to explore UI/UX design. Using Figma, I craft intuitive and visually appealing interfaces, ensuring seamless user experiences. I believe that good design is essential for creating products that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.
          
          Furthermore, I possess a strong foundation in C++ programming, developing calculation-based applications ranging from simple table generators and calculators to more complex systems like student or hospital management programs. This demonstrates my ability to tackle diverse programming challenges and build robust software solutions.
          
          I'm a lifelong learner, always eager to expand my knowledge and explore new technologies. I'm excited to collaborate with others and contribute my skills to innovative projects.
          
          Let's connect and discuss how I can help you bring your ideas to life!</p>
